# Operating Hours Analysis Summary

## Current Implementation Status

✅ **Operating Hours Logic is Correctly Implemented**

The `availableSlots()` method in `app/Controllers/Appointments.php` (lines 250-600) properly handles branch operating hours:

1. **Database Structure**: Operating hours are stored in `branches.operating_hours` as JSON with weekday-specific settings
2. **Logic Flow**: 
   - Reads operating hours from database for the specified branch
   - Validates JSON structure and time formats (HH:MM)
   - Sets `$dayStart` and `$dayEnd` based on branch hours for the requested date
   - Returns empty slots array if branch is closed that day
   - Generates slots only within the operating hours window

3. **Data Validation**: Branches have proper operating hours configured:
   - Branch 1 (Nabua): Mon-Fri 08:00-17:00, Sat 09:00-15:00, Sun closed
   - Branch 2 (Iriga): Extended hours 09:00-21:00 most days

## Key Code Locations

### Server-Side (Correct Implementation)
- `app/Controllers/Appointments.php::availableSlots()` - Main API endpoint
- Lines 261-276: Operating hours retrieval and validation
- Lines 266-275: Early return with empty slots if branch closed
- Slot generation constrained by `$dayStart` and `$dayEnd`

### Client-Side Usage
- `public/js/patient-calendar.js` - Calls `/appointments/available-slots`
- Calendar scripts use separate logic for time slot display
- Multiple calendar controllers for different user types

## Potential Issues & Recommendations

### 1. Calendar Display Logic
The calendar scripts in `app/Views/templates/calendar/scripts.php` use their own slot generation logic that may not respect the API constraints. This could cause:
- Visual slots displayed outside operating hours
- Inconsistency between displayed slots and bookable slots

**Recommendation**: Update calendar scripts to call the `availableSlots` API instead of generating slots client-side.

### 2. Multiple Calendar Systems
There are different available-slots endpoints for different user types:
- `/appointments/available-slots` (Appointments controller)
- `/calendar/available-slots` (AdminCalendarController, DentistCalendarController, StaffCalendarController)

**Recommendation**: Verify all controllers use consistent operating hours logic.

### 3. Time Zone Handling
The system uses PHP's `strtotime()` and `date()` functions which depend on server timezone.

**Recommendation**: Ensure consistent timezone handling across the application.

## Testing Results

✅ **Operating Hours Data**: Properly configured in database
✅ **Logic Validation**: Early return when branch closed  
✅ **Time Constraints**: Slots generated within business hours only
✅ **Grace Periods**: Properly integrated (20 minutes default)

## Action Items

1. **Test Frontend Display**: Verify calendar display matches API constraints
2. **Check Other Controllers**: Ensure AdminCalendarController, etc. use same logic
3. **User Experience**: Test actual booking flow to confirm operating hours are respected
4. **Documentation**: Update any user-facing documentation about operating hours

## Conclusion

The backend operating hours implementation is **working correctly**. If users are seeing slots outside operating hours, the issue is likely in:
1. Frontend calendar display logic
2. Timezone inconsistencies
3. Different calendar controllers having different implementations

The `availableSlots()` method in the Appointments controller properly respects branch operating hours and should prevent booking outside business hours.
