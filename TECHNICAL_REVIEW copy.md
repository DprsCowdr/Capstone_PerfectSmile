# CodeIgniter Application Technical Review (Capstone_PerfectSmile)

Date: 2025-08-11
Repository: DprsCowdr/Capstone_PerfectSmile (branch: main)

---

## A. Executive Summary

- Purpose: A dental clinic management system (Perfect Smile) built on CodeIgniter 4 that supports user roles (admin, dentist, staff, patient), patient management, appointment booking/approval, treatment checkups, billing, and dashboards.
- Health Score: Yellow — Works with clear structure and role separation, but has notable security hardening gaps (CSRF not enforced, no session regeneration on login, debug routes exposed), performance concerns (date-wrapped predicates preventing index use), and missing CI/CD and deployment automation.

---

## B. Full System Map — “At a glance”

- Key directories

  - app/
    - Config/ (App, Routes, Filters, Security, Database, Validation)
    - Controllers/ (Auth, AdminController, Dentist, Patient, StaffController, Checkup, TreatmentQueue, PatientCheckin, Home, Debug, etc.)
    - Models/ (UserModel, AppointmentModel, … Branch*, Procedure*, Service*, Dental*)
    - Services/ (AuthService, DashboardService, AppointmentService, …)
    - Traits/ (AdminAuthTrait)
    - Database/ (Migrations, Seeds)
    - Views/ (admin/_, dentist/_, patient/_, checkup/_, auth/_, templates/_)
  - public/ (index.php)
  - vendor/ (CodeIgniter 4 framework)
  - tests/ (example database test scaffolding and phpunit config)
  - .env (development config; DB connection)

- Quick glossary of custom terms
  - AppointmentModel: Central model for scheduling/approval/status lifecycle
  - AdminController: Admin dashboard and CRUD for users/patients/appointments
  - AuthFilter: Session-based gate; supports role arguments
  - DashboardService: Stats and view-model composition helpers
  - Treatment Queue/Checkin: Flow for same-day visits (checked_in → ongoing → completed)

---

## C. Detailed Step-by-Step Walkthrough (ground up)

1. Boot & config

- public/index.php boots CodeIgniter 4 with PHP >= 8.1, loads Config\\Paths, then system Boot.php.
- app/Config/App.php
  - baseURL: http://localhost:8080/
  - indexPage: '' (nice clean URLs)
  - forceGlobalSecureRequests: false
- app/Config/Filters.php
  - Aliases include csrf, auth, forcehttps, pagecache, performance, toolbar.
  - required.before includes forcehttps and pagecache; required.after includes pagecache, performance, toolbar.
  - globals.before has csrf commented out (CSRF not globally active).
- app/Config/Security.php
  - csrfProtection = 'cookie'; tokenRandomize = false; regenerate = true.
- app/Config/Database.php is skeletal; actual connection comes from .env.
- .env (development)
  - database.default: MySQLi @ 127.0.0.1, DB name perfectsmile_db, username root, password root.

2. Routing

- app/Config/Routes.php defines explicit routes; auto-routing appears disabled by use of explicit definitions.
- route groups guarded by 'auth' filter for admin, dentist, patient, staff, checkup, queue, checkin.
- Debug routes exist and are publicly accessible.

3. Controllers & Flow

- Auth handles login/register/logout using UserModel::authenticate() and session flags.
- AdminController extends BaseAdminController (not shown here), composes services, and enforces auth via trait methods that call AuthService.
- Patient, Dentist, StaffController provide role-specific dashboards and features.
- Debug controller exposes troubleshooting pages and test data creation.

4. Models & Data

- UserModel with validation and password hashing hooks; authenticate() uses password_verify and checks status = 'active'.
- AppointmentModel centralizes scheduling, approval, state transitions; includes helper queries for dashboards and availability.

5. Views

- Tailwind-styled templates; login view lacks CSRF hidden token.

6. Testing

- phpunit.xml.dist configured for CI4 PHPUnit 10; tests directory has example database tests and scaffolding.

## D. Login Flow — EXACT step-by-step example

Example: POST /auth/login

1. Client GET /login → Auth::index() returns view('auth/login') if not logged in.
2. User submits form to POST /auth/login with email/password.
3. Routes: app/Config/Routes.php → $routes->post('auth/login', 'Auth::login');
4. Controller: app/Controllers/Auth.php → login()
   - Extracts email/password from $this->request->getPost(...)
   - Validates non-empty; on fail → flash error, redirect()->back()
   - Calls $this->userModel->authenticate($email, $password)
     - app/Models/UserModel.php::authenticate() queries by email, verifies password_hash and active status
   - On success: session()->set([... 'isLoggedIn' => true, 'user_id' => ..., 'user_type' => ...])
   - Redirects by user_type: admin → /admin/dashboard, dentist → /dentist/dashboard, patient → /patient/dashboard, staff → /staff/dashboard
   - On failure: flash 'Invalid email or password', redirect()->back()
5. Missing/weak security checks identified
   - No session_regenerate_id(true) on successful login (risk: session fixation)
     - File: app/Controllers/Auth.php (login method, around lines 35–70)
   - CSRF not enabled globally; login form view lacks CSRF token field
     - File: app/Views/auth/login.php (no csrf_field())
     - File: app/Config/Filters.php (globals.before: 'csrf' commented out)
   - No rate limiting or lockout after repeated failures
   - 'Remember me' checkbox unused; no secure persistent session/cookie implemented

Recommended minimal patches

- Regenerate session ID on login and clear on logout:
  - app/Controllers/Auth.php (login): call session()->regenerate(true) immediately after setting session values.
  - app/Controllers/Auth.php (logout): call session()->destroy(); optionally session()->regenerate(true) post-destroy.
- Enable CSRF for POST routes:
  - app/Config/Filters.php: add 'csrf' to globals.before, or to methods POST, or per-route in Routes.php.
  - app/Views/auth/login.php: include <?= csrf_field() ?> inside the form.
- Optional: Add basic throttling using a simple counter in session or a rate-limit library.

---

## E. Security & Best Practices Checklist

- CSRF: Not enabled globally. Forms like auth/login lack csrf_field(). Action: enable 'csrf' filter and add hidden token to state-changing forms (login, register, create/update, delete, approve/decline).
- Session Management: No session ID regeneration on login; recommend session()->regenerate(true) on auth success and after logout. Consider setting cookie attributes (Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite) via config.
- Transport Security: Filters::$required includes 'forcehttps' but App::$forceGlobalSecureRequests=false. Verify local dev setup; in production set App::$forceGlobalSecureRequests=true and ensure HTTPS termination. Consider HSTS headers via SecureHeaders filter.
- Authentication/Authorization: AuthFilter supports role arguments but routes groups are using 'auth' without role args. Consider 'auth:admin' for admin group, and role-specific protection for dentist/staff/patient.
- Debug Endpoints: Public debug routes exist ('/debug', '/debug/\*'). Restrict to development environment or remove in production.
- Dependency Security: composer.json present, but no audit recorded. Run composer audit and address vulnerabilities; also run npm audit if any frontend dependencies are used.
- Password Handling: Uses password_hash/password_verify; good. Ensure PASSWORD_DEFAULT is current; consider PASSWORD_ARGON2ID if available.
- CSRF Token Randomization: tokenRandomize=false; consider enabling to reduce token reuse risk.
- CORS/Headers: CORS alias exists; not configured. Ensure proper CORS policy if exposing APIs.
- Input Validation: Good use of validation rules in models and controllers. Ensure all data-changing endpoints enforce rules server-side.

## F. Performance & Scalability Analysis

- Query hotspots and patterns

  - DATE-wrapped predicates on indexed datetime columns prevent index use:
    - app/Models/AppointmentModel.php
      - getAppointmentsByDate(): where('DATE(appointment_datetime)', $date)
      - getTodayAppointments(): where('DATE(appointments.appointment_datetime)', $today)
      - Debug controller: similar where('DATE(appointment_datetime)', ...)
    - Recommendation: Use range predicates: appointment_datetime >= '{$date} 00:00:00' AND < '{$date}+1 day'
  - N+1 risk:
    - AdminController::users() loops users and queries BranchUserModel per user. Replace with a single join + group_concat or prefetch mapping.
  - Availability check loops all dentists and counts conflicts per dentist (multiple queries):
    - AppointmentModel::getAvailableDentists() runs countAllResults() per dentist. Prefer a single query to fetch conflicting dentist IDs for the time slot, then array-diff against active dentists.

- Indexing & constraints

  - Add indexes:
    - appointments(appointment_datetime)
    - appointments(status)
    - appointments(approval_status)
    - appointments(dentist_id, appointment_datetime)
    - appointments(user_id)
  - Add foreign keys for appointments.user_id → user.id, appointments.dentist_id → user.id, appointments.branch_id → branches.id if not already enforced.

- Concurrency & sessions

  - Default file-based sessions are adequate for single-instance. For scaling to multiple instances, move to Redis or database-backed session handler.

- Caching
  - pagecache filter is in required before/after; verify actual page cache usage and correctness with auth pages (avoid caching authenticated responses).

---

## G. Tests & CI/CD

- Tests present:
  - phpunit.xml.dist configured for PHPUnit 10; tests directory contains example tests and DB fixtures scaffolding. No domain-specific tests yet.
- Recommended tests:
  - AuthController login success/failure and session regeneration.
  - AppointmentModel date-range queries, approval, decline (without hard delete), and availability logic.
  - Route protection tests (role-based access via AuthFilter).
- CI/CD:
  - No GitHub Actions or other pipelines found. Add minimal CI: composer install, vendor/bin/phpunit, composer audit, PHPStan/Psalm, PHP-CS-Fixer, and optional Dusk/Cypress for E2E.

---

## H. Deployment & Environment

- Environment variables:
  - .env holds DB credentials (development). Move secrets to environment variables in production (.env not committed) and set encryption.key.
- Required env for production:
  - CI_ENVIRONMENT=production
  - app.baseURL=https://your-domain/
  - database.default.\*
  - encryption.key=base64:...
  - session.savePath or session handler settings
- Health checks:
  - Add a simple GET /health returning app version and DB connectivity status.
- Migrations/Seeds:
  - Migrations present under app/Database/Migrations; use spark migrate in deploy.
- Static assets:
  - Served from public/; consider versioned assets and CDN if traffic grows.

---

## I. Maintainability & Code Quality

- Style/Standards: Generally PSR-like; consistent namespaces and CI4 structure.
- Complexity hotspots:
  - AdminController has long methods aggregating multiple responsibilities (view composition, validation, branching). Extract services and view models further when feasible.
  - AppointmentModel mixes validation/business rules, query helpers, and side effects (throwing exceptions during insert/update). Consider service-layer validations with domain exceptions.
- Duplication:
  - Password hashing occurs in both model callbacks and certain controllers (storeUser/updateUser). Standardize on model callbacks only, or centralize in a UserService.
- Documentation:
  - Add PHPDoc for public methods and clarify inputs/outputs; define enums/constants for statuses and types.

---

## J. Actionable Remediation Plan (prioritized)

Quick wins (0–2 hours)

1. Enable CSRF and add tokens to forms

   - Issue: CSRF filter not enabled; forms miss token
   - Files:
     - app/Config/Filters.php (globals.before)
     - app/Views/auth/login.php (and other forms)
   - Patch example (Filters.php):
     - Add 'csrf' to globals.before
   - Patch example (login view): add <?= csrf_field() ?>
   - Effort: Low

2. Regenerate session on login/logout

   - Issue: Session fixation risk
   - File: app/Controllers/Auth.php (login/logout)
   - Patch: session()->regenerate(true) after successful login; ensure destroy + optional regenerate on logout
   - Effort: Low

3. Hide/guard debug routes
   - Issue: Public debug endpoints
   - File: app/Config/Routes.php
   - Patch: wrap in if (ENVIRONMENT !== 'production') or remove
   - Effort: Low

Medium (1–3 days) 4) Replace DATE() filters with range queries; add DB indexes

- Issue: Poor index utilization
- Files: app/Models/AppointmentModel.php (getAppointmentsByDate, getTodayAppointments); app/Controllers/Debug.php
- Patch: Use >= and < ranges; add migration to create indexes
- Effort: Medium

5. Role-precise filters in routes

   - Issue: 'auth' used without role args; enforce least privilege
   - File: app/Config/Routes.php
   - Patch: use 'auth:admin', 'auth:dentist', 'auth:staff', 'auth:patient'
   - Effort: Medium

6. Non-destructive declines

   - Issue: declineAppointment() deletes records; loses audit trail
   - File: app/Models/AppointmentModel.php (declineAppointment)
   - Patch: update status='cancelled' or approval_status='declined' and store reason
   - Effort: Medium

7. Add brute-force throttling to login
   - Issue: No rate limiting
   - Files: Auth controller or a LoginThrottle service; store IP/email counters in cache
   - Effort: Medium

Strategic (weeks) 8) CI/CD and quality gates

- Add GitHub Actions: composer validate, install, phpunit, composer audit, static analysis, coding standards, artifact packaging.

9. Session store & horizontal scaling
   - Move sessions to Redis/DB; front as stateless as possible for multi-instance.
10. Domain refactor

- Extract business rules from models/controllers to services; use DTOs, enums, and repositories. Add feature tests covering main flows.

```diff
 public array $globals = [
     'before' => [
-        // 'honeypot',
-        // 'csrf',
+        // 'honeypot',

-    {
-        log_message('info', "Appointment {$appointmentId} declined with reason: {$reason}");
-        return $this->delete($appointmentId);
-    }
+    public function declineAppointment($appointmentId, $reason)

+        return $this->update($appointmentId, [
+            'approval_status' => 'declined',
+            'status'          => 'cancelled',
+            'decline_reason'  => $reason,
+            'updated_at'      => date('Y-m-d H:i:s'),
+        ]);
+    }
```

- app/Config/Routes.php — restrict debug to dev

```php
if (ENVIRONMENT !== 'production') {
    $routes->get('debug', 'Home::debug');
    $routes->get('debug/appointments', 'Debug::checkAppointments');
    $routes->get('debug/add-test', 'Debug::addTestAppointment');
}
```

- Optional: role-specific group filters (if using filter arguments)

```php
$routes->group('admin', ['filter' => 'auth:admin'], function($routes) { /* ... */ });
$routes->group('dentist', ['filter' => 'auth:dentist'], function($routes) { /* ... */ });
$routes->group('staff', ['filter' => 'auth:staff'], function($routes) { /* ... */ });
$routes->group('patient', ['filter' => 'auth:patient'], function($routes) { /* ... */ });
```
