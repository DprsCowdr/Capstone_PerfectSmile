// Test 3: Identify problems
echo "3. Problems Identified:\n";
echo "❌ Duration too long: 180 minutes (3 hours) is excessive\n";
echo "❌ Limited slots: Only 3 available slots shown\n";
echo "❌ Poor distribution: Slots are clustered together (1:50-1:54 PM)\n";
echo "❌ Late start: First slot at 1:50 PM instead of 9:00 AM\n";
echo "❌ JavaScript issue: Admin calendar not displaying slots\n\n";

// Test 4: Recommended fixes
echo "4. Recommended Fixes:\n";
echo "✅ Reduce service duration to 30-60 minutes\n";
echo "✅ Fix JavaScript to properly display slots in admin calendar\n";
echo "✅ Generate more distributed slots throughout operating hours\n";
echo "✅ Show slots starting from operating hours (9:00 AM)\n";
